# ElevenLabs API Key Setup

Guide the user through obtaining and configuring an ElevenLabs API key.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Request the API key

Tell the user:

> To set up ElevenLabs, open the API keys page: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
>
> (Need an account? Create one at https://elevenlabs.io/app/sign-up first)
>
> If you don't have an API key yet:
> 1. Click "Create key"
> 2. Name it (or use the default)
> 3. Set permission for your key. If you provide a key with "User" permission set to "Read" this skill will automatically verify if your key works
> 4. Click "Create key" to confirm
> 5. **Copy the key immediately** - it's only shown once!
>
> Paste your API key here when ready.

Then wait for the user's next message which should contain the API key.

### Step 2: Validate and configure

Once the user provides the API key:

1. **Validate the key** by making a request:
   ```
   GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user
   Header: xi-api-key: <the-api-key>
   ```

2. **If validation fails:**
   - Tell the user the API key appears to be invalid
   - Ask them to try again
   - Remind them of the URL: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
   - If it fails a second time, display an error and exit

3. **If validation succeeds**, save the API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<the-api-key>
   ```

4. **Confirm success:**
   > Done! Your key is stored as an environment variable in .env
   > Keep the key safe! Don't share it with anyone!
